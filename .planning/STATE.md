## Project Reference

**Milestone:** v2.0 — V3 Adaptive Strategy Dispatch System

**Total Phases (this milestone):** 5 (Phases 6–10)
**Total Requirements (this milestone):** 20

## Accumulated Context

### Carried Forward from v1.0

- Daily swing strategy is the ONLY validated signal source; H1 scalp/momentum layers destroy alpha when run concurrently — valid ONLY as separately dispatched strategies via router
- RAG filter (ChromaDB) boosts Sharpe from 1.67 to 2.08 — non-negotiable feature
- Hurst regime filter added in final v1.0 commit — not yet validated in live conditions
- BEC partial close shelved until win rate >= 40% (currently 35.4%)
- MT5 EA compiles but has no live connection to Python signal engine
- USDJPY is the crown jewel (Sharpe 3.09, 44.4% win rate)
- IC Markets Raw Spread account is the target broker

### Key Decisions for v2.0

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| ZMQ bridge (not file-polling, not named pipes) | Sub-10ms latency; file-polling has 1s latency + lock risk; named pipes Windows-only |
| Adaptive router over single-strategy dispatch | H1 scalp/momentum valid as isolated dispatched strategies — not concurrent layers |
| 4yr validation window for routing matrix | Replaces 730-day numbers with statistically stronger evidence |
| OnlineRegimeFilter only (Viterbi banned) | Prevents future-bar leakage in both backtest and live |
| Swing-first priority in router | Daily swing fires whenever conditions met; intraday only when no swing position open |
| 7-day IC Markets demo as live gate | Validates live dispatch matches backtest expectation within 20% before real capital |
| Fill replaces OrderResult in V2 (D-08) | class OrderResult does not exist in V2/bridge/ — V2 uses Fill throughout (06-01) |
| SCHEMA_VERSION=1 module constant (D-06) | Single source of truth for schema version in V2/bridge/schemas.py (06-01) |
| unpack_heartbeat returns dict not datetime64 (D-07) | Consumer can check schema_version on connect — deliberate V1 breaking change (06-01) |
| zmqContext.destroy(0) omitted from OnDeinit (06-04) | coke5151 RAII destructor handles context cleanup on scope exit — explicit destroy causes double-free crash |
| _handle_bar_frame dual-decoder: msgpack first, JSON fallback (06-04) | Consumer resilient to both V2 msgpack (Python-to-Python) and MQL5 JSON Option A payload formats |
| PYTHONPATH=V1/helix for V1 baseline capture (08-01) | V1's alpha/__init__.py uses absolute `from src.alpha.*` imports — package root must be V1/helix, not V1/helix/src |
| parity_baseline.npz committed to repo (08-01) | Frees CI from any V1 environment dependency; .npz captured once via _capture_v1_baseline.py |
| Wave 0 = 41 RED tests for REGM-01/02/03/04 (08-01) | Mirrors Phase 7 P01 pattern; Plans 02/03/04 turn them GREEN |
| HMMGARCHRegimeDetector ported verbatim from V1 minus predict_viterbi method and _compute_log_emission_probs helper (08-02 / D-04) | REGM-04 Viterbi ban enforced by-construction at the source; the only consumer of _compute_log_emission_probs was predict_viterbi |
| bars_to_log_returns helper accepts both 'close' and 'Close' columns (08-02 / D-20) | V1 / synthetic tests use lowercase; Phase 7 _H1_4yr.csv files use Title-case — single helper covers both |

### Critical Gates

| Gate | Phase | What It Unlocks |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| BRDG-03 DLL compatibility spike | Phase 6 | Phase 10 EA work — **PASS (2026-04-23): coke5151 fork, MT5 build 5800, Ubuntu+Wine 11.7 Staging. Phase 10 unblocked.** |
| BKTS-01 entry bias fix | Phase 7 | Trusted Sharpe numbers for BKTS-02/03 routing matrix entries |
| REGM-04 Viterbi ban | Phase 8 | Phase 9 router 4yr simulation (ROUT-04) |
| ROUT-04 simulation Sharpe gate | Phase 9 | Phase 10 live deployment |
| LIVE-04 7-day paper trade | Phase 10 | Live capital deployment |

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** Phase 8 Plan 02 complete — HMMGARCHRegimeDetector ported from V1 minus Viterbi (D-04); 18 tests GREEN (5 emissions + 4 bars_to_log_returns + 9 regime_detector); REGM-01 offline-fit half + REGM-02 variance-rank pinning satisfied by-construction; hmmlearn 0.3.3 + arch 8.0.0 resolved. Continuation agent finished after previous agent hit usage limit mid-plan. (2026-04-25)
**Last agent:** execute-phase
**Next action:** Execute Phase 8 Plan 03 (Wave 2: OnlineRegimeFilter + PitClock + detector persistence — turns test_online_filter / test_pit / test_persistence GREEN)
